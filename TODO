=== CALIBRATION ===

* hyrid calibration, pnp correspondence with ransac, remove 
  outliers, do plane <-> plane correspondence.

* use pcl::registration::TransformationEstimationSVD instead 
  of cv::estimateAffine3D to calibrate the extrinsic between
  two calibration clouds.

* range error between 3d/2d marker may not be as much of a 
  problem if projective registration is used, as with full
  3D SVD. One source for the range difference is the change
  of intrinsic parameters compared to the reference 
  calibration (changing focus). Use the distribution of
  errors to estimate a new camera matrix and do full
  marker extraction and extrinsic calibration again.
